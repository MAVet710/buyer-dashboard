### Page 1 — 📊 Inventory Dashboard

**What it does:** Calculates Days-on-Hand (DOH), reorder status, overstock flags, and expiring SKUs across your entire inventory.

**Step-by-step:**
1. In the sidebar, upload your **Inventory File** (CSV or Excel) and your **Product Sales Report** (XLSX).
2. Optionally upload an **Extra Sales Detail** file (revenue-level XLSX) and a **Quarantine List** (CSV or Excel).
3. Adjust **Forecast Settings** (Target DOH, Velocity Adjustment, Days in Sales Period) in the sidebar.
4. Browse the **SKU Inventory Buyer View** tabs — All Inventory, Reorder, Overstock, and Expiring.
5. Use the **Export** button to download the buyer view as an Excel file.

#### Required columns — Inventory File (CSV or Excel)

The dashboard auto-detects column names. Export from Dutchie or BLAZE without editing headers.

| Purpose | Accepted column names (any of these) |

### Page 2 — 📈 Trends

**What it does:** Provides a category mix breakdown, package size mix, top movers by velocity, and fast-mover / low-stock risk scoring.

No additional file uploads are needed — this page uses the same inventory and sales files uploaded on the Inventory Dashboard page.

---

### Page 3 — 🚚 Delivery Impact

**What it does:** Measures whether a product delivery correlates with an uptick in daily revenue.

**Step-by-step:**
1. Upload your **Delivery/Receiving Report** (CSV or XLSX).
2. Upload your **Daily Sales Report** (CSV or XLSX).
3. Select the analysis window (3, 7, or 14 days before/after delivery).
4. View the revenue lift table and summary metrics.

#### Required columns — Delivery/Receiving Report (CSV or XLSX)

| Purpose | Accepted column names (any of these) |

### Page 4 — 🐢 Slow Movers

**What it does:** Identifies products with excess Days-on-Hand and assigns action badges and discount tiers.

No additional file uploads are needed — this page uses the same inventory and sales files uploaded on the Inventory Dashboard page.

Use the filter bar to narrow results by category, brand, DOH threshold, and velocity window. Export the full slow-mover analysis to Excel (3 sheets: Slow Movers, Summary, Full Detail).

---

### Page 5 — 🧾 PO Builder

**What it does:** Generates a purchase order PDF pre-populated with flagged reorder items from the Inventory Dashboard.

**Step-by-step:**
1. Visit the **Inventory Dashboard** first so reorder data is loaded.
2. Navigate to **PO Builder** and click **"Add all flagged reorder items"** to pre-populate the PO.

## Session & Data Persistence

- Uploaded files are stored **in memory for the current calendar day** (per user login).
- If your session times out (typically after ~30 minutes of browser inactivity on Streamlit Cloud), simply **log back in** — your files from today will be restored automatically.
- Files are **not** stored on disk or in any external database. They live in server memory and are cleared at midnight or when the server restarts.
- Click **"🧹 Clear uploads (today & session)"** in the sidebar to manually remove all stored files.

## Slow Movers & Trends — Glossary

### Days-on-Hand (DOH)
> **DOH = Units on Hand ÷ Daily Run Rate**

DOH tells you how many days the current stock will last at the current rate of sale. A product with 100 units and a daily run rate of 2 units has **50 days of supply**. Products above the configurable threshold (default: **60 days**) are flagged as slow movers.

### Weeks of Supply
> **Weeks of Supply = DOH ÷ 7**

A weeks-based view of the same metric — useful when your buying cycle is measured in weeks. A product at 14 weeks of supply has ~98 days of stock on hand.

### Avg Weekly Sales
> **Avg Weekly Sales = Total Units Sold in Window ÷ (Window Days ÷ 7)**

Computed over the selected **velocity window** (28, 56, or 84 days). Use a shorter window for recent demand signals; use a longer window to smooth out promotional spikes or seasonal dips.

### Velocity Window
The number of calendar days used when calculating average sales rate. Options:
- **28 days** — captures the most recent demand, sensitive to short-term changes.
- **56 days (default)** — balances recency and stability; recommended for most buyers.
- **84 days** — smooths out spikes; better for seasonal or slow-moving categories.

### Slow Mover Score
A 0–100 composite score where **100 = completely stuck** (no sales in window). It is derived from how far the product's DOH exceeds the 180-day ceiling. Use the score to rank products when you have many items near the threshold.

### Action Badge
Each product receives an action badge based on DOH and weekly sales:

| Badge | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ Healthy | DOH ≤ 60 days — no action needed |
| 🟢 Monitor | DOH 61–90 days |
| 🟡 Watch | DOH 91–120 days — consider a small promo |
| 🟠 Markdown | DOH 121–180 days — discount recommended |
| 🔴 Promo / Stop Reorder | DOH > 180 days — urgent action |
| 🔴 Investigate | No sales data or zero velocity — check data |
| ⬛ No Stock | Zero units on hand |

## Inventory Dashboard — Buyer View

The **📋 SKU Inventory Buyer View** section inside the Inventory Dashboard provides a buyer-focused, SKU-level analysis of your on-hand stock.

### How It Works
The buyer view reads the same uploaded inventory and sales files and computes metrics at the individual SKU level (one row per product name).

### Filter Bar
- **Search** — filter by product name, SKU, or brand/vendor (case-insensitive).
- **Velocity window** — same 28 / 56 / 84-day options as Slow Movers (see glossary above). Controls avg weekly sales and DOH calculations.
- **Show top N** — limit results to 25 / 50 / 100 or All SKUs after sorting.
- **Sort by** — buyer-focused options: `$ on hand ↓`, `DOH (high→low) ↓`, `DOH (low→high) ↑`, `Expiring soonest`, `Avg weekly sales ↓`.
- **Category / Subcategory** — dropdown populated from inventory data.
- **Vendor / Brand** — dropdown populated from inventory data (requires a brand/vendor column).
- **Expiration window** — `Any` / `<30 days` / `<60 days` / `<90 days` — filters by days until the earliest expiration date per SKU.
- **On-hand > 0** — toggle to hide SKUs with zero units (default: ON).
- **DOH min / max** — fine-tune the days-of-hand range shown.

### Tabs
| Tab | Default Filter | Default Sort |
|---|---|---|
| 📦 All Inventory | Active filter bar settings | Selected "Sort by" |
| 🔴 Reorder | DOH ≤ 21 days | DOH ascending (most urgent first) |
| 🟠 Overstock | DOH ≥ 90 days | $ on hand descending |
| ⚠️ Expiring | Earliest expiry < 60 days | Days to expire ascending |

Thresholds (21 / 90 / 60) are defined as constants `INVENTORY_REORDER_DOH_THRESHOLD`, `INVENTORY_OVERSTOCK_DOH_THRESHOLD`, and `INVENTORY_EXPIRING_SOON_DAYS` at the top of `app.py` and can be adjusted there.

### KPI Strip
Above each tab's table, five tiles reflect the **currently filtered data**:
- **📦 SKUs in stock** — count of SKUs with on-hand > 0.
- **💰 Total $ on hand** — sum of `on-hand units × current price` (requires cost column).
- **🔴 Reorder SKUs** — count of SKUs with Reorder status.
- **🟠 Overstock SKUs** — count of SKUs with Overstock status.
- **⚠️ Expiring <60d** — count of expiring SKUs and dollars tied up.

### Status Badge Criteria
| Badge | Criteria |
|---|---|
| ⬛ No Stock | On-hand = 0 |
| ⚠️ Expiring | Earliest expiry < 60 days (checked first for in-stock SKUs) |
| 🔴 Reorder | DOH > 0 and DOH ≤ 21 days |
| 🟠 Overstock | DOH ≥ 90 days (includes SKUs with no sales data) |
| ✅ Healthy | All other in-stock SKUs |

### Optional Inventory Columns
The buyer view works without these columns but unlocks additional features when present:

| Column | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `current price` / `unit cost` / `cost` / `wholesale` | Enables $ on hand, $ tied up expiring KPIs |
| `brand` / `vendor` | Enables Vendor/Brand filter dropdown |
| `expiration date` / `expiry` / `best by` | Enables Expiring tab and Days-to-Expire column |

Missing columns are reported as an info message above the filter bar.
